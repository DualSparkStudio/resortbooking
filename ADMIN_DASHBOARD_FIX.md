# Admin Dashboard Fix - Removed Booking and Facilities Options

## Issue
Admin users were able to access booking and facility exploration options, which are inappropriate for administrative users who should focus on management tasks only.

## Root Cause
The system had two separate dashboard routes:
1. `/dashboard` - Regular user dashboard with booking/facilities options
2. `/admin` - Admin dashboard with management tools

However, admin users could still access the regular `/dashboard` route, which showed:
- "Book a Room" quick action card
- "Explore Facilities" quick action card
- "My Dashboard" link in admin dropdown menu

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Dashboard Route (`routes.py`)
```python
@app.route('/dashboard')
@login_required
def dashboard():
    # Redirect admin users to admin dashboard
    if current_user.is_admin:
        return redirect(url_for('admin_dashboard'))
    
    bookings = Booking.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).order_by(Booking.created_at.desc()).all()
    return render_template('dashboard.html', bookings=bookings)
```

**What this does:**
- Automatically redirects admin users to the admin dashboard (`/admin`) when they try to access `/dashboard`
- Regular users continue to see the normal dashboard with booking options
- Prevents admin users from accidentally accessing booking features

### 2. Removed "My Dashboard" Link from Admin Menu (`templates/admin/base.html`)
**Removed:**
```html
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ url_for('dashboard') }}">
    <i class="fas fa-user me-2"></i>My Dashboard
</a></li>
```

**What this does:**
- Eliminates the confusing "My Dashboard" link from admin dropdown menu
- Admin users now only have access to appropriate admin functions
- Streamlines the admin interface

## Current Admin Dashboard Structure

The admin dashboard now provides only administrative functions:

### Sidebar Navigation:
- **Dashboard** - Overview and statistics
- **Bookings** - Manage all reservations
- **Rooms & Types** - Manage room inventory
- **Facilities** - Manage resort amenities
- **Resort Closures** - Manage closure periods
- **Users** - Manage user accounts
- **View Website** - Access public website
- **Logout** - Sign out

### Quick Actions (Dashboard):
- Manage Bookings
- Manage Rooms  
- Manage Users
- View Website

### User Dropdown Menu:
- **View Website** - Access public site for testing
- **Logout** - Sign out

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Admin users only see administrative functions
2. **Prevents Confusion**: No booking options that admins shouldn't use
3. **Improved User Experience**: Streamlined interface focused on management tasks
4. **Security**: Reduces risk of admins accidentally making bookings

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Login as admin** (admin/admin123)
2. **Try accessing `/dashboard`** - Should redirect to `/admin`
3. **Check admin dropdown menu** - Should not show "My Dashboard" option
4. **Verify admin sidebar** - Should only show management options
5. **Use "View Website" link** - Should access public site for booking/facilities if needed

## Result

Admin users now have a clean, focused dashboard experience without booking or facility exploration options, while still being able to access the public website when needed for testing or customer support purposes.
